The **Tinkerers Track** is for developers with little or no prior blockchain/Polkadot experience who want to experiment, explore, and build something fun during the hackathon.

> 👉 This track is about **creativity, exploration, and fun** — just tinker and build!  

You can build:  

- 🌉 Cross-chain apps  
- 📊 Data crunching & visualizations  
- 🎨 UX improvements  
- 🧪 Proof of Concepts  
- ✨ Vibe-coded projects  

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

### 🤖 Using AI to Tinker Faster  

You don’t need to know everything — let AI do some heavy lifting:  

- **GitHub Copilot for repos**: Open a repo like [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and ask Copilot to explain code, functions, or modules. Great for finding answers to “obscure” questions.  

- **Query docs with AI**: Use an AI assistant to query [docs.polkadot.com](https://docs.polkadot.com/) directly — it saves time vs. searching manually.  

### APIs & SDKs  
- [**Polkadot API (PAPI)**](https://papi.how/) — modern TypeScript API for Polkadot.  
- [**DeDot**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/dedot) — lightweight TypeScript library for Polkadot SDK chains, great for quick prototypes.  
- [**Sidecar**](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/) — REST service for blockchain data.  
- [**Subxt**](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt) — Rust client for Polkadot SDK–based chains.
- [**Paraspell**](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)  - Library which makes working with XCM and interoperability on Polkadot easy.

### Data & Indexing  
- [**SubQuery**](https://subquery.network/) — index and query blockchain data.  
- [**Polkaholic**](https://polkaholic.io/) — cross-chain explorer & API.  
- [**DotLake**](https://wiki.polkadot.scr/docs/learn-data-lake) — open data lake for analytics.  

### Wallets
- [**Talisman Wallet**](https://www.talisman.xyz/)  
- [**SubWallet**](https://subwallet.app/)  
- [**Polkadot Vault**](https://signer.parity.io/)  

### Infrastructure  
- [**Tanssi**](https://www.tanssi.network/) — deploy your own **appchain** quickly to pair with your hackathon project.  
  - Great for experimenting with custom logic or integrating your app with its own chain.  
  - Request free testnet tokens here to deploy: [Claim Dance Tokens](https://www.tanssi.network/claim-dance-tokens).  
- [**Bagpipes**](https://alpha.bagpipes.io/) — no-code solution for building and testing **XCM/interoperability flows** across the Polkadot ecosystem.  

### UI Helpers  

- [**Polkadot Telemetry**](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/) — real-time visualization of multiple networks.

## 💻 Tinkering with Replit  

If you’re new to coding, or just want to get a proof of concept running fast, [**Replit**](https://replit.com/) is a great place to tinker with creating applications on Polkadot. You don’t need to install anything locally: just open your browser, prompt replit (or use a template), and start experimenting.  

You can use Replit to:  
- Prototype UIs (React, Vue, or plain JS/HTML).  
- Experiment with Polkadot APIs like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, or other libraries / tools that are mentioned.
- Fetch and visualize on-chain data without worrying about setup.  

 Replit has built-in **AI prompting**. You can paste in code snippets or ask it to use libraries like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, **Subxt**, **SubQuery**, or **Sidecar** directly in your project. This makes it much easier to get started, even if you don’t know the exact function calls.  

👉 In other words: Replit is your **sandbox for Polkadot tinkering** — experiment quickly, share instantly, and learn by doing.    

## 🚀 Approaches for Tinkerers  

- **Start with APIs** — fetch balances, transfers, staking info, and display them in a presentable way.
- **Visualize data** — build dashboards, graphs, creative art from chain telemetry and data.
- **Improve UX** — prototype wallet flows, simplify onboarding, or provide unique recovery methods for wallets.  
- **Hack with vibes** — memes, mashups, or unique experiments welcome!  
- **Spin up an appchain** — use Tanssi to launch a chain tied to your own app.  
- **Test interoperability** — use Bagpipes to design and simulate XCM flows without code.  

## 💡 Example Project Ideas  

- 🔗 Cross-chain NFT gallery using PAPI  
- 📊 Validator analytics dashboard with SubQuery 
- 🧪 Experiment with creating no-code tools for the Polkadot ecosystem. 
- 🖼️ Data art from block and transaction history.
- 🔥 A custom appchain (via Tanssi) powering a unique hackathon app.  
- 🌐 A no-code cross-chain XCM flow demo using Bagpipes.  

## 🧩 Tinkering Examples  

These show how beginners can **mix and match tools**:  

1. **API + Visualization**  
   - Fetch balances and transfers via **DeDot** or **PAPI**.  
   - Pipe the data into a simple **D3.js chart** to show how account balances evolve over time.  

2. **Custom Appchain with Tanssi + UI**  
   - Deploy a small **appchain on Tanssi** for your app.  
   - Take advantage of their Network modules feature to create or [mix-and-match modules](https://docs.tanssi.network/learn/framework/modules/)
   - Create a simple web app to display data from your appchain
