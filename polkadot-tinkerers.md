The **Tinkerers Track** is for developers with little or no prior blockchain/Polkadot experience who want to experiment, explore, and build something fun during the hackathon.

> üëâ This track is about **creativity, exploration, and fun** ‚Äî just tinker and build!  

You can build:  

- üåâ Cross-chain apps  
- üìä Data crunching & visualizations  
- üé® UX improvements  
- üß™ Proof of Concepts  
- ‚ú® Vibe-coded projects  

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started  

### ü§ñ Using AI to Tinker Faster  

You don‚Äôt need to know everything ‚Äî let AI do some heavy lifting:  

- **GitHub Copilot for repos**: Open a repo like [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and ask Copilot to explain code, functions, or modules. Great for finding answers to ‚Äúobscure‚Äù questions.  

- **Query docs with AI**: Use an AI assistant to query [docs.polkadot.com](https://docs.polkadot.com/) directly ‚Äî it saves time vs. searching manually.  

### Primary APIs & SDKs  

- [**Polkadot API (PAPI)**](https://papi.how/) ‚Äî modern TypeScript API for Polkadot.  
- [**DeDot**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/dedot) ‚Äî lightweight, reactive TypeScript library for Polkadot SDK chains.
- [**Sidecar**](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) ‚Äî REST service for blockchain data.  
- [**Subxt**](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt) ‚Äî Rust library to interact Polkadot SDK‚Äìbased chains.
- [**Paraspell**](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)  - Library which makes working with XCM and interoperability on Polkadot easy.
- [**create-dot-app**](https://github.com/preschian/create-dot-app) ‚Äî CLI to scaffold Polkadot dApps with multiple frameworks option and PAPI/DeDot. 

### Data & Indexing  

- [**SubQuery**](https://subquery.network/) ‚Äî index and query blockchain data.  
- [**DotLake**](https://github.com/paritytech/dotlake-community) ‚Äî a data ingestion pipeline for Substrate-based blockchains (like Polkadot), view it in action [here](https://data.parity.io).

### Wallets

- [**Talisman Wallet**](https://www.talisman.xyz/)  
- [**SubWallet**](https://subwallet.app/)
- [**Polkadot.js Extension**](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
- [**Nova Wallet**](https://novawallet.io/)
- [**Polkadot Vault**](https://vault.novasama.io/)  

### Infrastructure  

- [**Pop! CLI**](https://onpop.io/) ‚Äî is a developer platform for Polkadot that makes it easy to **build, test, and deploy** smart contracts or appchains with a streamlined CLI.

### UI Helpers  

- [**Polkadot Telemetry**](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/) ‚Äî real-time visualization of multiple networks.

## üé• Video Resources

## üíª Tinkering with Replit  

If you‚Äôre new to coding, or just want to get a proof of concept running fast, [**Replit**](https://replit.com/) is a great place to tinker with creating applications on Polkadot. You don‚Äôt need to install anything locally: just open your browser, prompt replit (or use a template), and start experimenting.  

You can use Replit to:  
- Prototype UIs (React, Vue, or plain JS/HTML).  
- Experiment with Polkadot APIs like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, or other libraries / tools that are mentioned.
- Fetch and visualize on-chain data without worrying about setup.  

 Replit has built-in **AI prompting**. You can paste in code snippets or ask it to use libraries like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, **Subxt**, **SubQuery**, or **Sidecar** directly in your project. This makes it much easier to get started, even if you don‚Äôt know the exact function calls.  

üëâ In other words: Replit is your **sandbox for Polkadot tinkering** ‚Äî experiment quickly, share instantly, and learn by doing.    

## üöÄ Approaches for Tinkerers  

- **Start with APIs** ‚Äî fetch balances, transfers, staking info, and display them in a presentable way.
- **Visualize data** ‚Äî build dashboards, graphs, creative art from chain telemetry and data.
- **Improve UX** ‚Äî prototype wallet flows, simplify onboarding, or provide unique recovery methods for wallets.  
- **Hack with vibes** ‚Äî memes, mashups, or unique experiments welcome!  
- **Spin up an appchain** ‚Äî use Tanssi to launch a chain tied to your own app.  

## üåê Deployed Examples

This section highlights **working examples** you can fork, get inspiration from, build on right away. Each entry links to a repo and (where available) a quick summary/tutorial to help you get started fast.  

- [**EduChain**](https://github.com/w3f/educhain) ‚Äî An example parachain developed by the TechEd team at W3F for education and credentialing, showing how the Polkadot SDK can power real-world solutions.

### Building with Typescript (dApps)

**Building decentralized applications (dApps) on Polkadot using TypeScript.** dApps on Polkadot are web applications that interact with parachains and/or a relay chain through client libraries. Each chain has a set of custom modules, called **pallets**, which the library can take advantage of (TODO: add link to pallet matrix).

They typically feature wallet integration, real-time chain data display, and transaction submission.

### Building with Rust

**Rust is the native language for Polkadot development.** Use Rust to build high-performance applications, CLI tools, backend services, or entirely new blockchain runtimes. Rust offers compile-time safety, zero-cost abstractions, and direct access to Polkadot's native APIs and primitive types.

### REST / Data / Indexing

**Access blockchain data through REST APIs and build analytics dashboards.** These tools provide alternative ways to interact with Polkadot networks without running full nodes, and enable building data-driven applications with historical analysis capabilities.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sidecar** | REST API for blockchain data | Need HTTP API access or integrating with non-blockchain systems | https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar | `docker compose` from repo | *(none yet ‚Äî use curl scripts in repo)* | *(Add "try these 3 endpoints")* |

### Infrastructure / Local chain deployments (optional for Tinkerers)

**Tools for local development and testing environments.** Set up local networks for rapid prototyping, testing parachain features, or developing custom blockchain logic before deploying to testnets or mainnet.

| Tool | What it's for | When should I use this? | Docs (URL) | Starter / Template (URL) | Working Example(s)  | Tutorial(s)  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
