The **Tinkerers Track** is for developers with little or no prior blockchain/Polkadot experience who want to experiment, explore, and build something fun during the hackathon.

> 👉 This track is about **creativity, exploration, and fun** — just tinker and build!  

You can build:  

- 🌉 Cross-chain apps  
- 📊 Data crunching & visualizations  
- 🎨 UX improvements  
- 🧪 Proof of Concepts  
- ✨ Vibe-coded projects  

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

### 🤖 Using AI to Tinker Faster  

You don’t need to know everything — let AI do some heavy lifting:  

- **GitHub Copilot for repos**: Open a repo like [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and ask Copilot to explain code, functions, or modules. Great for finding answers to “obscure” questions.  

- **Query docs with AI**: Use an AI assistant to query [docs.polkadot.com](https://docs.polkadot.com/) directly — it saves time vs. searching manually.  

### APIs & SDKs  

- [**Polkadot API (PAPI)**](https://papi.how/) — modern TypeScript API for Polkadot.  
- [**DeDot**](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/toolkit/api-libraries/dedot) — lightweight TypeScript library for Polkadot SDK chains, great for quick prototypes.  
- [**Sidecar**](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) — REST service for blockchain data.  
- [**Subxt**](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt) — Rust library to interact Polkadot SDK–based chains.
- [**Paraspell**](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)  - Library which makes working with XCM and interoperability on Polkadot easy.

### Data & Indexing  

- [**SubQuery**](https://subquery.network/) — index and query blockchain data.  
- [**DotLake**](https://github.com/paritytech/dotlake-community) — a data ingestion pipeline for Substrate-based blockchains (like Polkadot), view it in action [here](https://data.parity.io).

### Wallets

- [**Talisman Wallet**](https://www.talisman.xyz/)  
- [**SubWallet**](https://subwallet.app/)
- [**Polkadot.js Extension**](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
- [**Nova Wallet**](https://novawallet.io/)
- [**Polkadot Vault**](https://vault.novasama.io/)  

### Infrastructure  

- [**Pop! CLI**](https://onpop.io/) — is a developer platform for Polkadot that makes it easy to **build, test, and deploy** smart contracts or appchains with a streamlined CLI.

### UI Helpers  

- [**Polkadot Telemetry**](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/) — real-time visualization of multiple networks.
- [**create-dot-app**](https://github.com/preschian/create-dot-app) — CLI to scaffold Polkadot dApps with multiple frameworks option and PAPI/DeDot. 

## 🎥 Video Resources

**Polkadot Deep Dives** is a playlist of in-depth explorations into different FRAME pallets. These videos are brought to you by Parity’s Delivery Services team, where they dive deep into all things Polkadot development and ecosystem.

## 💻 Tinkering with Replit  

If you’re new to coding, or just want to get a proof of concept running fast, [**Replit**](https://replit.com/) is a great place to tinker with creating applications on Polkadot. You don’t need to install anything locally: just open your browser, prompt replit (or use a template), and start experimenting.  

You can use Replit to:  
- Prototype UIs (React, Vue, or plain JS/HTML).  
- Experiment with Polkadot APIs like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, or other libraries / tools that are mentioned.
- Fetch and visualize on-chain data without worrying about setup.  

 Replit has built-in **AI prompting**. You can paste in code snippets or ask it to use libraries like **PAPI**, **DeDot**, **Subxt**, **SubQuery**, or **Sidecar** directly in your project. This makes it much easier to get started, even if you don’t know the exact function calls.  

👉 In other words: Replit is your **sandbox for Polkadot tinkering** — experiment quickly, share instantly, and learn by doing.    

## 🚀 Approaches for Tinkerers  

- **Start with APIs** — fetch balances, transfers, staking info, and display them in a presentable way.
- **Visualize data** — build dashboards, graphs, creative art from chain telemetry and data.
- **Improve UX** — prototype wallet flows, simplify onboarding, or provide unique recovery methods for wallets.  
- **Hack with vibes** — memes, mashups, or unique experiments welcome!  
- **Spin up an appchain** — use Tanssi to launch a chain tied to your own app.  

## 🌐 Out in the Wild - Deployed Examples

This section highlights **working examples** you can fork, get inspiration from, build on right away. Each entry links to a repo and (where available) a quick summary/tutorial to help you get started fast.  

- **EduChain** → [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/w3f/educhain)  
  *An example parachain developed by the TechEd team at W3F for education and credentialing, showing how the Polkadot SDK can power real-world solutions.*  

- **create-polkadot-dapp** → [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/paritytech/create-polkadot-dapp)  
  *A starter template for quickly scaffolding Polkadot dApps with minimal setup.*  

## 🧩 Tinkering Examples  

These show how beginners can **mix and match tools**:  

1. **API + Visualization**  
   - Fetch balances and transfers via **DeDot** or **PAPI**.  
   - Pipe the data into a simple **D3.js chart** to show how account balances evolve over time.
